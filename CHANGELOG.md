# PHP Function Injection Companion Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A description page for the inspection in **Settings | Editor |
  Inspections**, which showed "Under construction".

### Changed

- The rating prompt's local counter keeps one-way fingerprints of findings
  instead of their file paths, and deletes the list that earlier versions
  kept.
- `PRIVACY.md` describes the values the plugin keeps in the IDE's local
  settings.

## [0.1.1]

### Fixed

- Review/star CTA now links to this plugin's own Marketplace
  reviews page instead of the vendor's generic plugin list.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Warning on `call_user_func`/`call_user_func_array` whose function
  name is built directly from a PHP superglobal -- Function
  Injection, not covered by "PHP Inspections (EA Extended)".
- 100% static text analysis, no PHP plugin dependency, no network
  calls, no telemetry. Free.
